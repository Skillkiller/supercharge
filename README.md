## Information & Motivation

This web application allows collecting and analyzing League of Legends champion mastery points stats of summoners who have registered their account on the page to be tracked. This allows keeping track and analyzing your porgress on champion masteries and being able to observe your progerssion.

This project is strongly inspired by [masterypoints.com](https://masterypoints.com), which provides a detailed insight about your champion mastery points and world wide rankings, but leaks of providing detailed analysis and tracking of the progress of your mastery points and [Orianna Bot](https://orianna.molenzwiebel.xyz), which provides detailed mastery point information via Discord.

The name `supercharge` is inspired by the E spell of the League of Legends champion Kai'Sa, which is the main champion of a good friend of mine. And it fits well to the functionality of the app to provide "supercharged" analytics about champion mastery points.

## Setup & Hosting

> I will only provide guidence on how to set up the server environemtn using the provided Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml`. I will neither provide any binaries nor any documentation on how to compile and set up the server components outside of docker. If you want to do so nevertheless, you should have the knowledge on compiling .NET Core projects and running them.

First of all, clone the repository somewhere on your server:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zekroTJA/supercharge . --branch master --depth 3
```

After that, you should check the configuration n the `docker-compose.yml` and define secrets like the Riot API key or the password for the database account. To get an API key for the Riot API, you need to register a product application [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/app-type).

Then, build all nessecary images with the build scripts provided in the `docker-compose.yml`:
```
$ docker-compose build
```

After that and after checking and configuring the `docker-compose.yml`, you are ready to start up the services with the following command:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Eventually, you can check the status of the services:
```
$ docker-compose ps
```
