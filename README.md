### [DatabaseAccessLayer](DatabaseAccessLayer)

This is a .NET Standard 2.1 Class Library which acts as access layer for the database and provides the Entity Framework database context and the database access class which can be implemented via dependency injection.

### [RestAPI](RestAPI)

This ASP.NET Core (3.1) application provides a REST API gateway to the data provided by the database which is used by the front end web application.

## Setup & Hosting

> I will only provide guidence on how to set up the server environemtn using the provided Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml`. I will neither provide any binaries nor any documentation on how to compile and set up the server components outside of docker. If you want to do so nevertheless, you should have the knowledge on compiling .NET Core projects and running them.

First of all, clone the repository somewhere on your server:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zekroTJA/masterypointsstats . --branch master --depth 3
```

After that, you should check the configuration n the `docker-compose.yml` and define secrets like the Riot API key or the password for the database account. To get an API key for the Riot API, you need to register a product application [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/app-type).

Then, build all nessecary images with the build scripts provided in the `docker-compose.yml`:
```
$ docker-compose build
```

After that and after checking and configuring the `docker-compose.yml`, you are ready to start up the services with the following command:
```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Eventually, you can check the status of the services:
```
$ docker-compose ps
```
